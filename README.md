Received some press in [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/discretionary-spending-in-the-us-has-doubled-since-the-1960s-2018-9), [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/50-years-u-s-discretionary-spending/), [Digg](http://digg.com/2018/us-discretionary-spending-over-time), [The Independent Institute](http://blog.independent.org/2018/09/24/the-growth-of-discretionary-and-mandatory-spending/).

The underlying data is available for download from the Office of Management and Budget [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/) (tables 8.6 and 8.8).

Beware, the code is quite ugly.
